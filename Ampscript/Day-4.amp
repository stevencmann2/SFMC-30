Day 4 Challenge

An outdoor equipment company has launched a “Refer-a-Friend” program in their stores and wants to send an email to its customers that includes a personalised message based on whether the customer has provided a valid referral email address.

The email should include the message "We confirm that we have received your referral email address" if the customer has provided a valid email address and "Please provide us with a valid referral email address" if the customer has not provided a valid email address.

Excited to take on today's challenge? Take a look at the sample dataset and email preview.


💡 Today’s Hint
You can use the IsEmailAddress to validate whether a given string is a valid email address. The function returns a boolean value of true if the string is a valid email address, and false if it is not.

var @email, @firstname, @lastName, @referralEmail, @isValidEmail

SET @email = AttributeValue("Email")
SET @firstname = AttributeValue("FirstName")
SET @lastName = AttributeValue("LastName")
SET @referralEmail = AttributeValue("ReferralEmail")
SET @isValidEmail = IsEmailAddress(@referralEmail)


If @isValidEmail == 'true' then
  set @message = "We confirm that we have received your referral email address."
else
  set @message = "Please provide us with a valid referral email address."
endif
