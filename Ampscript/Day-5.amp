Day 5 Challenge

A florist wants to include a discount promotion in its weekly newsletter. 
The discount offer will vary depending on the customer's upcoming birthday. 
If the customer's birthday is within the next 7 days, they will receive a 15% discount. 
If the customer's birthday is within the next 14 days, they will receive a 10% discount. 
If the customer's birthday is not within the next 14 days, they will receive a 5% discount.

For each challenge, a dataset and an email preview are available to help you get started. You can download them here.


ðŸ’¡ Todayâ€™s Hint
You can use the DateDiff function to calculate the difference between two dates in a specific time unit, such as days or hours.

/* SET @birthday = AttributeValue("Birthdate") */

SET @currentDate = SystemDateToLocalDate(Now())
SET @diffYears = dateDiff(@birthday, @currentDate, "Y")
SET @nextBirthday = DateAdd(@birthday, @diffYears, "Y")

SET @now = Now()

IF @nextBirthday < FormatDate(@now,"s") THEN
     SET @nextBirthday = DateAdd(@nextBirthday, "1", "Y")
