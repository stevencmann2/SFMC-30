Day 6 Challenge

A fitness company wants to send a personalized email to each customer with their Body Mass Index (BMI) calculated based on their weight and height. The calculated BMI will be included in the email with one decimal place. BMI is calculated using the following formula: weight in kg / (height in m)2

If youâ€™re unsure where to start, a sample data set is available here and can serve as a helpful starting point for the challenge.
