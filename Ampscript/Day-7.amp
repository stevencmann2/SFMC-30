Day 7 Challenge

A telecommunication company provides a yearly subscription plan to its customers. 
Customers can choose to pay for the subscription annually or monthly. 
The company wants to include the renewal date of the subscription in the payment confirmation email, so customers can keep track of when they need to renew their subscription.

A sample data set is available here to help you get started with the challenge.
