/* Day 7 â€“ Find Business Admins
NextMobile has two types of customers: business customers and personal customers. 
The data feed for business customers is slightly different from that of personal customers. 
The team plans to send a new email about upcoming product changes, specifically targeting administrators for business accounts. 
Your task is to run a query to find these administrators.
